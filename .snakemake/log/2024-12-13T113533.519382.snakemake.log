MissingOutputException in rule proc_structural in file /home/bic/eyang/micapipe/rules/structural.smk, line 2:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/home/bic/eyang/processed_data2/sub-mri3T/ses-01/anat/processed_volumetric.nii.gz
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
