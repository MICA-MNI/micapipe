What's new?
================================================

v0.2.2 'Northern Flicker'
-------------------------------------

**General**

- FIX issue with multiple acquisitions when `-proc_dwi` was used with `-dwi_acq`. Including the following modules `SC`, `QC` and `QC_subj`.
- FIX instance when multi echo processing has no spike regression file now calculates the nuisance regression correctly.
- FIX an issue with the dimensions of the tSNR file in `proc_func`.

**QC group**

- Set higher thresholds for GD and SC in the similarity subjects matrices for better outlier detection.
- NEW vertex-wise and ROI variance per feature.
- NEW histograms of features and variances per ROI and vertex-wise.

**QC_subj**

- NEW a surface plot of the tSNR to the `proc_func` module in `QC_subj`.


v0.2.1
-------------------------------------
- We fixed the usage of `-QC` and `-QC_subj` for those datasets with single session.
- Update a conditional in `proc_surf` that search for the `ribbon.mgz`
- Add a missing variable in `-SC` when using `-autotrack`

v0.2.0
-------------------------------------
üë•   Compatible with multiple acquisitions (func, dwi, MPC). multiple quantitative maps, DWI acquisitions and func acquisitions including task

üß†   Improved registrations between modalities. We improved the registration between multiple acquisitions to optimize the performance.

üåê   Surface mapping from native space in all modules.

üî¨   Optimized for high resolution processing (tested on 0.5-1mm3, e.g 7T)

üí¶   MP2RAGE processing workflow (3T and 7T) for structural images, including a cleaning of the salt and pepper background noise.

‚ú®   Optimize to process ultra high resolution 7T datasets, with new CNN based processing tools.

‚ö°Ô∏è   NEW FLAIR processing module

üîç   New QC subject and group level more informative with a lot of new features and pdf (new json files for QC)

üëæ   New algorithms  (brain mask, surface reconstructions - fastsurfer)

üõ•Ô∏è   Docker container

üêõ   A lot of bugs fixed


v0.1.5
-------------------------------------

**General changes**
-  Update print help
-  Removed unused flags
-  Update the documentation (partially)
-  UPDATE jsons to increase `pyBIDS` compatibility
-  FIX bug on MPC output directory

**`proc_func` and `FC`**
-  Rename flags on `proc_func`  `-regress_WM_CSF` to `-NSR`
-  FIX bug on glm regression matrix of cofounding (higher precision)

**`proc_dwi` and `SC` upgrade**
-  Manage multiple acquisitions `-dwi_acq`
-  `micapipe_cleanup` is up to date to erase multiple acquisitions
-  `-b0thr` allows the user to set a threshold to determine the volumes that correspond to b=0, default=61
-  `-no_bvalue_scaling` disable the diffusion b-values scaling of the corresponding DWI norm (see Mrtrix3 for further info)


v0.1.4
-------------------------------------
-  Update FSL from 6.0.0 to 6.0.3
-  `mica-pipe` command goes to `micapipe`
-  To print help should specify it with the flag `micapipe -h` or `micapipe -help`
-  `post_structural` will always run schefer-400 by default if is not included in the `-atlas` list
-  `proc_rsfmri` is deprecated and replaced by `proc_func`
-  `proc_func` handles more than one functional acquisition (e.g. tasks), as well as multi echo data (tedana https://github.com/ME-ICA/tedana).
-  `proc_func` Added option to drop the first 5 TRs -dropTR (by default is not dropped)
-  `proc_func` Added option to not run the functional connectomes -noFC (only func surface data)
-  `proc_func` Added 6 parameters of motion to the regression of -regress_WM_CSF (func\~spikes+6motion+wm+csf)
-  `proc_func` Added 6 parameters of motion to the regression of -GSR (func\~spikes+6motion+wm+csf+gs)
-  `MPC` can processes more than one quantitative map (at a time) with the flag `-mpc_acq <qMRI_name>`
-  `micapipe_cleanup` can be called from `micapipe` command: `micapipe -cleanup`
-  `micapipe -cleanup` uses the string `-acqStr` to erase multiple acquisitions of `-proc_func` and `-MPC`
-  Improved comments and print logs of `-proc_func` and `FC.py`
-  `proc_func` generates new jsons files of each acquisition with metadata about processing and completion status
-  `proc_func` exit status when Melodic/FIX fail
-  `-QC_subj` is not compatible with `proc_func` yet.... or with MPC multiple acquisitions but it is still with the old `proc_rsfmri` outputs
-  NOTE: the read the docs is not updated yet.


v0.1.2
-------------------------------------
**Fixed**

-  Added missing semicolon to SC line 74

-  Issue with transformations management in SC when only AFFINE was applied

- 'str_dwi_affine' variable name corrected dwi in -SC

-  Typo in notification of completition (a missing 's') in proc_struc
