.. title:: Install micapipe

Installation
========================================================

In general, there are two distinct ways to install and use ``micapipe``:
either through virtualization/container technology, that is `Docker`_ or
`Singularity`_, or in a `Bare metal version`_.
Using a container method is highly recommended as they entail entire operating systems through kernel level virtualization and
thus include all software necessary to run ``micapipe``, while at the same time presenting a lightweight alternative to virtual machines.
Once you are ready to run ``micapipe``, see `Usage Notes <../01.execution/index.rst>`_ for details.

Docker
======

In order to run ```micapipe``` in a Docker container, Docker must be `installed
<https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`_ on your system.
Once Docker is installed, you can get ``micapipe`` through running the following
command in the terminal of your choice:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker pull micalab/micapipe:version

Where ``version`` is the specific version of ``micapipe`` you would like to use. For example, if you want 
to employ the ``latest``/most up to date ``version`` you can either run 

.. code-block:: bash

    docker pull micalab/micapipe:latest

or the same command without the ``:latest`` tag, as ``Docker`` searches for the ``latest`` tag by default.
However, as the ``latest`` version is subject to changes and not necessarily in synch with the most recent ``numbered version``, it 
is recommend to utilize the latter to ensure reproducibility. For example, if you want to employ ``micapipe v0.0.2`` the command would look as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker pull micalab/micapipe:v0.0.2

After the command finished (it may take a while depending on your internet connection),
you can run ``micapipe`` like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker run -ti --rm \
        -v path/to/your/bids_dataset:/bids_dataset:ro \
        -v path/to/your/bids_dataset/derivatives:/output_directory \
        -v path/to/your/working_directory:/tmp \
        -v path/to/your/freesurfer_license_file.txt:/opt/freesurfer-6.0.0/freesurfer_license_file.txt \
        micalab/micapipe:latest \
        -bids /bids_dataset \
        -out /output_directory \
        -all -ses 01 \
        -threads 10 -tracts 10M

Please have a look at the examples under `Usage Notes <../01.execution/index.rst>`_ to get more information
about and familiarize yourself with ``micapipe``'s functionality.


Singularity
===========

For security reasons, many HPCs (e.g., TACC) do not allow Docker containers, but support
 `Singularity <https://github.com/singularityware/singularity>`_ containers. Depending
on the ``Singularity`` version available to you, there are two options to get ``micapipe`` as
a ``Singularity image``.

Preparing a Singularity image (Singularity version >= 2.5)
----------------------------------------------------------
If the version of Singularity on your HPC is modern enough you can create a ``Singularity
image`` directly on the HCP.
This is as simple as: 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ singularity build /my_images/micapipe-<version>.simg docker://micalab/micapipe:<version>

Where ``<version>`` should be replaced with the desired version of ``micapipe`` that you want to download.
For example, if you want to use ``micapipe v0.0.2``, the command would look as follows.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ singularity build /my_images/micapipe-v0.0.2.simg docker://micalab/micapipe:v0.0.2


Preparing a Singularity image (Singularity version < 2.5)
---------------------------------------------------------
In this case, start with a machine (e.g., your personal computer) with ``Docker`` installed and
the use `docker2singularity <https://github.com/singularityware/docker2singularity>`_ to
create a ``Singularity image``. You will need an active internet connection and some time. 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker run --privileged -t --rm \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        -v /absolute/path/to/output/folder:/output \
        singularityware/docker2singularity \
        micalab/micapipe:<version>

Where ``<version>`` should be replaced with the desired version of ```micapipe``` that you want
to download and ``/absolute/path/to/output/folder`` with the absolute path where the created ``Singularity image``
should be stored. Sticking with the example of ``micapipe v0.0.2`` this would look as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker run --privileged -t --rm \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        -v /absolute/path/to/output/folder:/output \
        singularityware/docker2singularity \
        micalab/micapipe:v0.0.2

Beware of the back slashes, expected for Windows systems. The above command would translate to Windows systems as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker run --privileged -t --rm \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        -v D:\host\path\where\to\output\singularity\image:/output \
        singularityware/docker2singularity \
        micalab/micapipe:<version>


You can then transfer the resulting ``Singularity image`` to the HPC, for example, using ``scp``. ::

    $ scp micalab_micapipe<version>.simg <user>@<hcpserver.edu>:/my_images

Where ``<version>`` should be replaced with the version of ```micapipe``` that you used to create the ``Singularity image``, ``<user>``
with your ``user name`` on the HPC and ``<hcpserver.edu>`` with the address of the HPC.  

Running a Singularity Image
---------------------------

If the data to be preprocessed is also on the HPC, you are ready to run ``micapipe``. 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ singularity run --cleanenv /my_images/micapipe-<version>.simg \
        -B path/to/your/bids_dataset:/bids_dataset:ro \
        -B path/to/your/bids_dataset/derivatives:/output_directory \
        -B path/to/your/working_directory:/tmp \
        -B path/to/your/freesurfer_license_file.txt:/opt/freesurfer-6.0.0/freesurfer_license_file.txt \
        micapipe<version>.simg \
        -bids /bids_dataset \
        -out /output_directory \
        -all -ses 01 \
        -threads 10 -tracts 10M

.. note::

    Make sure to check the name of the created ``Singularity image`` as that might
    diverge based on the method you used. Here and going forward it is assumed that you used ``Singularity >= 2.5``
    and thus ``micapipe-<version>.simg`` instead of ``micalab_micapipe<version>.simg``.   


.. note::

   Singularity by default `exposes all environment variables from the host inside
   the container <https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/issues/445>`_.
   Because of this your host libraries could be accidentally used
   instead of the ones inside the container.
   To avoid such situation we recommend using the ``--cleanenv`` singularity flag.


.. note::

   Depending on how ``Singularity`` is configured on your cluster it might or might not
   automatically ``bind`` (``mount`` or ``expose``) ``host folders`` to the container.
   If this is not done automatically you will need to ``bind`` the necessary folders using
   the ``-B <host_folder>:<container_folder>`` ``Singularity`` argument.



"Bare-metal" installation
=========================
.. warning::

   This method is not recommended! Make sure you would rather do this than
   use a `Docker`_ or a `Singularity`_.

Make sure all of ``micapipe``'s `External Dependencies`_ are installed.
These tools must be installed and their binaries available in the
system's ``$PATH``.
A relatively interpretable description of how your environment can be set-up
is found in the `Dockerfile <https://github.com/MICA-MNI/micapipe/blob/master/Dockerfile>`_.
Micapipe can be directly downloaded from Github as follows: ::

    git clone https://github.com/MICA-LAB/micapipe.git

Paths to all dependencies will need to be changed manually to :ref:`set your environment <what_need>`.

External Dependencies
---------------------
``Micapipe`` relies on several software dependencies. If you are opting for a bare-metal installation, you will need to set up these dependencies for all ``micapipe`` modules to run smoothly.

     - **Freesurfer**  6.0     (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/)
     - **FSL**         6.0     (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki)
     - **AFNI**        20.2.06 (https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/download)
     - **MRtrix3**     3.0.0   (https://www.mrtrix.org)
     - **ANTs**        2.3.3   (https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs)
     - **workbench**   1.3.2   (https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/connectome-workbench)
     - **FIX**         1.06    (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FIX) *optional*
     - **R**           3.6.3   (https://www.r-project.org)
     - **python**      3.7.6   (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

.. admonition:: Notes on ``FIX`` üßê

     `FIX <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811913011956?via%3Dihub>`_ (FMRIB‚Äôs ICA-based Xnoiseifier) is used in micapipe for removal of nuisance variable signal in resting-state fMRI data. For bare-metal installations, this portion of the functional processing will only run if FIX is found on the user's system. Note that FIX has several dependencies, specifically FSL, R and one of the following: MATLAB Runtime Component (MCR), full MATLAB or Octave. Version 1.06 of FIX relies on MATLAB 2017b/MCR v93. Additionally, it requires the following R libraries: 'kernlab','ROCR','class','party','e1071','randomForest'.
